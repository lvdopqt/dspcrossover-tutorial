# DSP & ESP32 Integration - Tutorial Repository

## Overview
This repository provides a step-by-step guide for integrating the ESP32 microcontroller with a DSP (Digital Signal Processor), focusing on communication protocols, programming, and interface control. The tutorial is available in both English (EN) and Portuguese (PT), covering essential topics such as IÂ²C, IÂ²S, SPI, ESP32 setup, DSP programming, and interface design with LCD, rotary encoders, and buttons.
The final result for this tutorial is in this repository: https://github.com/lvdopqt/dspcrossover
